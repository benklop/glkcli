<H2><FONT COLOR="#004EB2">Introduction</FONT></H2>
<P>
Some years ago, when text adventures were far more popular than they are at present, I wrote such a game for the BBC micro. It was published by <I>Acornsoft</I> under the name <I>Gateway to Karos</I> and was favourably reviewed in <I>Acorn User</I>. Encouraged by this I followed it up with a sequel: <I>The Mirror of Khoronz</I>. By the time <I>Mirror</I> was completed, however, graphical games were all the rage, text-only adventures were old hat, and <I>Acornsoft</I> were no longer interested.
<P>
Then came RISC OS. When I acquired an A3000 with what (then) seemed like oodles of memory and incredible speed I set about, more for the fun of the thing than anything else, to rewrite <I>Mirror of Khoronz</I> and make a <I>proper</I> job of it freed from the constraint of shoe-horning it into 32Kb. That was about 15 years ago but the project languished in the face of other needs and interests. 
<P>
But some things come round again and perhaps the time is ripe for the text adventure or work of &quot;interactive fiction&quot; to undergo a revival. Who was it said of radio and television that on radio the pictures were better? There have always been people who would much rather read a book than watch a TV or movie adaption of it, or listen to an opera rather than watch it because they like their own imagined visualisation of the characters and scenery than anything a director imposes on them. For such folk text adventures might be their idea of what a computer game should be.
<P>
So here is <I>The Mirror of Khoronz</I>, completed and polished to the best of my limited ability. You don't have to be familiar with the preceding <I>Gateway to Karos</I> in order to play it and, who knows, perhaps that too will be reincarnated in a vastly-improved RISC OS format? (We obtained permission from Acorn years ago to re-release <i>Karos</i> into the public domain.)

<DIV class="Section\ Style">
<H2><FONT COLOR="#004EB2">Playing &quot;Mirror&quot;</FONT></H2>
<P>
Double-click on the <I>!Mirror</I> application. The window which appears will display the text as the game develops together with the commands entered by the player. Those commands are entered in the input panel at the bottom of the window, followed by either clicking on the <B>OK</B> button or typing <B>Return/Enter</B>. As in all such games the computer is your eyes and hands. The program understands a wide variety of words to enable you to move from place to place, manipulate objects and perform other actions. The game contains approximately 300 locations and 100 objects and can be completed in something of the order of 400 moves and 200 other actions.
<P>
<DIV class="Section\ Style1">
<H3><FONT COLOR="#004EB5">Scenario</FONT></H3>
<P>
You have been transported against your will to an alien world, one which bears many similarities to our own with added features from our mythical and legendary past. Somehow you must find your way back. That's it really. The quest is a long and difficult one with many problems, puzzles and dangers along the way. You will also find that you are not the first wanderer to have been &quot;translated&quot; into this strange world. It's interactive fantasy fiction. Have fun!
</DIV>

<DIV class="Section\ Style1">
<H3><FONT COLOR="#004EB5">Movement</FONT></H3>
<P>
In most adventure games you move about by entering compass directions. Some games understand only NORTH, SOUTH, EAST and WEST or their abbreviations. <I>Mirror</I> also uses NE, SE, SW and NW. The unusual feature is its use of LEFT, RIGHT, FORWARD and BACK. When the scenario features the interiors of caves, mines and buildings this seems more natural than using compass directions. Note that BACK does <I>not</I> mean &quot;walk backwards&quot;! It means &quot;<I>turn around</I> and go back the way you came&quot; and a message always tells you this to remind you which way you're now facing. Stairs are normally dealt with using UP and DOWN and doors and related items with IN and OUT. 
<P>
Since this is a RISC OS-compliant application you are encouraged to use the mouse. The side panel has buttons which duplicate all 16 of the movement words mentioned above and these buttons are normally available unless you are trying to move about in the dark.
</DIV>

<DIV class="Section\ Style1">
<H3><FONT COLOR="#004EB5">In the dark?</FONT></H3>
<P>
Yes, some locations are dark and you'll need a light source to explore them. Candles etc. have a limited lifetime and you shouldn't use them when they're not needed. A handy reminder at the top of the side panel tells you whether your light source is ON or not. Exploring in the dark is <I>not</I> a good idea (except for the first few moves where you've no choice), although the program usually doesn't &quot;kill&quot; you without some sort of warning hint!
</DIV>

<DIV class="Section\ Style1">
<H3><FONT COLOR="#004EB5">Other commands</FONT></H3>
<P>
<I>Mirror</I> knows hundreds of words and can interpret hundreds of commands. Synonyms are widely implemented, e.g. you may use CLIMB or ASCEND as well as UP, and EXIT instead of OUT. All words may be abbreviated as long as the shortened word doesn't clash with another.
<P>
Although these notes use uppercase letters for commands you don't need to do so. The program forces all input to uppercase regardless.
<P>
<DIV class="Section\ Style2">
<H4><I><FONT COLOR="#004EB5">Look</FONT></I></H4>
<P>
The descriptions of some locations are long and detailed (something which was quite impossible in the BBC micro version!). If you return to such a location you will often be given a much shorter description and a bare reminder of which way you can go from there. You can, however, always see the long description again by typing LOOK or clicking the corresponding button on the side panel. There's an option button <B>Long</B> which, if selected, causes the long descriptions to be used at all times.
</DIV>

<DIV class="Section\ Style2">
<H4><I><FONT COLOR="#004EB5">Objects</FONT></I></H4>
<P>
There are approximately 100 objects in <I>Mirror</I> and most of them can be picked up, left, examined and so on. Simple verb-noun pairs such as GET (or TAKE) CUP, DROP (or LEAVE) CUP and EXAMINE CUP are the most obvious commands. Use EXAMINE a lot - it will often give you important information about an object. 
<P>
The program isn't restricted to such simple commands: it can interpret things like DROP EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE MOUSETRAP, GET THE CHEESE, THEN GO NORTH,ENTER THE HOUSE,PUT THE CAT OUT AND SET THE TRAP. (In case you think there are clues here it must be said that there is no cup, mousetrap or cheese in the game, nor is there a house or a cat, but there is plenty of going North!)
<P>
Another indispensible command is INVENTORY (or simply INV); so important that it's action is duplicated with a button. It tells you what you're carrying and you'll soon see that some objects are containers in which other things can be put. The inventory list is indented to make this &quot;containment&quot; structure clear. Both the capacity of containers and the carrying ability of the player are limited.
<P>
As far as types of object are concerned, some are valuables (for which you gain a score), most are useful, a few are weapons, some are readable, some are magical. A few are mere &quot;stage properties&quot; and are actually useless but are there to add credibility to a background narrative which stalks this piece of interactive fiction. Most (but not all) of the readable objects are also there for this purpose but you do score points for finding and reading them.
<P>
Finally, not all gettable objects are immediately obvious. Most have their names printed in blue preceded by &quot;You can see:&quot; but sometimes an object forms an integral part of the location description. Read carefully and think.
</DIV>

<DIV class="Section\ Style2">
<H4><I><FONT COLOR="#004EB5">Saving and Loading positions</FONT></I></H4>
<P>
You may save the game situation at any time. Simply typing SAVE or clicking the disc icon on the side panel brings up a Save box. Default names offered are sequential names based on the player's name, e.g. FredA, FredB and are saved in the SavedPosit subdirectory inside the application. You may use any filename you like and type it directly as a command, e.g. SAVE HOUSE. Frequent saves are strongly recommended, especially before attempting anything complicated or potentially dangerous.
<P>
LOAD on its own displays the SavedPosit directory. You can then restore a saved position by dragging the appropriate file onto the text window. You can also load a file by typing, for example, LOAD HOUSE.
</DIV>

<DIV class="Section\ Style2">
<H4><I><FONT COLOR="#004EB5">Saving the game history</FONT></I></H4>
<P>
Clicking MENU over the text window brings up a Save box from which you can save a text file containing the entire text displayed up to that point. As with saved positions (see above) the names successively offered are HistoryA, HistoryB etc. but you may alter the leafname of the file to anything you wish.
Saving the history is rather slow because many control characters have to be stripped out to produce a &quot;clean&quot; text file but the hourglass gives an indication of progress.
</DIV> 

<DIV class="Section\ Style3">
<H4><I><FONT COLOR="#004EB5">Scoring</FONT></I></H4>
<P>
The maximum score is 1000, roughly half the points being for valuables and half for achievments of various kinds. To obtain a maximum score you must complete the game and find and investigate <I>every</I> object. In the early stages your score will not increase very quickly and you may be disconcerted to find it <I>decreasing</I> at times. This is normal and doesn't necessarily mean that a score of 1000 is out of your reach.
</DIV>
</DIV>

<DIV class="Section\ Style2">
<H4><I><FONT COLOR="#004EB5">Retrace</FONT></I></H4>
<P>
You might be wondering what this button on the control panel is for. It provides a quick way of reversing your progress from location to location. So as not to make things too easy Retrace is limited to 10 movements and there are parts of the game where it is disabled altogether.
</DIV>

<DIV class="Section\ Style2">
<H4><I><FONT COLOR="#004EB5">A multi-player game!</FONT></I></H4>
<P>
Yes, you can play <I>Mirror</I> with a friend or with your kids! It's a multi-player game, although some aspects of this feature still need more work. At any stage clicking the <B>New player</B> button requests the name of a new player and starts him/her at the beginning. Each active player is assigned one of the numbered function keys on the keyboard, starting with f1 for the first player, and pressing the appropriate key makes it that player's turn and displays the appropriate position. Players may go around together - there's a FOLLOW command to enable one player to tag along, without having to enter any commands, whenever another moves. The player being followed can LEAVE the follower and the link is broken anyway if the latter makes a direct move. 
<P>
Players can give objects to each other. Attempts to take objects from another player, or even to examine them are, however, met with a refusal.
<P>
Just in case you don't want other players to see what you typed to make something happen there's a <B>Hide</B> button next to the <B>OK</B> which conceals your input.
